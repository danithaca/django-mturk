django-mturk
======================

A django package built with boto to help you manage Amazon Mechanical Turk work with DRY principles.

__Development Status__: In development.


### Why

Django-mturk aims to help you develop Amazon Mechanical Turk django projects with the DRY principles, so you don't have to write data models for HITs, Assignments, etc. It uses boto to interact with Mturk at the low level.

### System Requirements

This is developed and tested under python 3.x and django 1.7. But the plan is to make it work with python 2.7+, 3.x and django 1.6 and 1.7.
